This is a multiplayer racing game designed for being open-sourced to Hack Club's Arcade. It's pretty fun to play with friends, and compiled versions can be found on Itch at https://kaileh57.itch.io/arcade-racing 
I've taken a lot of lessons learned from past multiplayer excursions, and this is my first full multiplayer game with actual gameplay, as well as being my first truly finished 3d game, even if it is pretty limited in scope.

Controls:
W   Accelerate
A/D Steer
S   Brake, holding this will put you in/out of reverse 
    Handbrake (Spacebar)
M   Start the race, host only
P   Reset to start
B   Screenshot
Backspace + ESC (backspace pressed first) to go back to title screen

Have fun!
